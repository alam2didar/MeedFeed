# MeedFeed
A social Webnetwork
For the IT 350 Final Project which is creating a Social Network for USNA, we the members of the Team-3 created “MidFeed.”, 
the most innovative social networking website which allows the Navy community to share and communicate personal and professional 
updates with each other in real time. This attractive and user friendly social networking site will meet the user’s demand from 
all Navy communities. Starting with Midshipmen, the USNA faculty, all navy members and naval academy familywill now get one step 
closer to maintain good communication with each other through technology despite of their very busy life style.

Speciality
Midfeed comes with very easy and user friendly features. First of all, it has a very nice and attractive looking “Welcome Page” 
with a nice touch of most updated CSS design. It has a nice and soothing appearance for the user which provides an easy Sign up 
and Login options. Its presentation of different quotes on every reload gives it a dynamic characteristic and feedback upon completing 

each action gives a user a perfect idea about how to navigate through the website. If a member is already signed up he can easily login 
by typing his username or email address. A new user can easily navigate through all the pages which are in public area without being
logged in which are Welcome page, Contact page, Search page, Signup page, User Profile page, and List of Member page. So a new user
who is not signed up can see the list of all members, their profile and can search any keyword and get back all the statuses containing 
that keyword. Clicking on Sign Up on the top left corner of the page will take a user to the sign up page. The sign up page is very 
innovative and gives user a lot of options supported with feedback. A user can choose between the choices of Midshipmen and faculty 
and the sign up page will provide appropriate feedbacks. One nice feature of this page is that it checks the email field for valid
e-mail (valid alpha for Midshipmen) and password field and changes its color between RED and GREEN depending on validity of input. 
Upon successful sign up it gives a greeting to the user and redirects to login page for the user to login with his new Username 
and commence the use of the site as a member. For any problem regarding the site or just to inquiry about the site a user can 
easily find the contact information for the authors (including pictures) of the site and their short biography.

The innovation and extra credits performed on this social networking site does not end here. We met “all” the necessary requirements 
for the project and accomplished more extra credits successfully. For an easier understanding following is a list with description of 
all innovative features and extra credits performed.
